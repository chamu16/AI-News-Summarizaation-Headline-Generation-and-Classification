# AI News Summarizaation, Headline Generation and Classification

## Introduction

In today's digital age, staying informed has become increasingly challenging due to the vast amount of data available. News summarization not only enhances the reader experience but also helps traditional news organizations adapt to the changing digital landscape while maintaining journalistic excellence. The role of summaries and headlines has become crucial in providing concise and relevant information to readers[1].



## Objective

●	Develop a comprehensive framework for producing concise summaries and appealing headlines using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing models.

●	Utilize various techniques such as NLP-based methods and deep learning algorithms to efficiently summarize and categorize news articles.

●	Create a complete framework for summarizing news articles, generating headlines, and classifying news articles into specific categories



## Conclusion

●	The proposed framework for summarization, headline generation, and article classification has been successfully implemented using various techniques and algorithms.

●	The results show that the model performs well in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and ROUGE score.

●	The framework can be used by traditional news organizations to adapt to the changing digital landscape and provide readers with concise and relevant information.

●	The study demonstrates the potential of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing models in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of news summarization and classification tasks.
